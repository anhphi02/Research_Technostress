# Topic: Understanding employees responses to technostress: A Coping Model of Employee adaptation

**Background:** In the context of digital transformation, techno-stressors, which are caused by rapid changes in technology and the inability to meet changing competencies, have been examined to have a negative impact on organization and employees. Despite the urgency of investigating effective coping strategies to handle techno-stress, this topic is hardly underexplored. In addition, the impact of task adaptation behavior on employeesâ€™ job performance still remains unclear

**Method:** This study has developed a research model by applying the coping theory with cognitive appraisal and employing multiple task adaptation behaviors to examine how employees deal with stress. The research team adopted a quantitative method and employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique by using SmartPLS to examine the measurement and structural model through the dataset of 323 respondents 

**Results:**  The findings have shown that when getting exposure to techno-stress, employees tend to adopt disturbance handling strategies and make suitable adaptation behaviors, which eventually enhances job performance. 

**Conclusion:** The results of this study are of great value for expanding both theoretical research and practical applications of coping strategies in relation to technostress and coping strategies.

**Keywords:** Stress-coping theory, technostress, job performance, cognitive appraisal, disturbance handling, self-preservation, exploitative task adaptation, exploratory task adaptation.
